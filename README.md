<h2> what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.</h2>
As the name suggests- the project is a treasure hunt where you have to solve riddles to move ahead. The theme is more like y2k video games kinda modern while still maintaing the spirit of an old scholl treasure hunt. We were striving to create a user friendly exprience where they can navigte the game easily and create a certain sense of nostalgia and remind the user of their childhood. The story of the game is structured around being a broke college student at NYUAD( pretty realistic) and strange charaters offering the user campus dirhams money if they manage to make it to the end of the game.

<h2>Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.</h2>
We started with shotting the videos with us asking the user riddles. It was so fun working together and asking the lady at the convenience store (huge shout out to Ludy for being the best actor in the entire film!!). The videos turned out exactly as we wanted them to be kinda grayish to go with the tv static background we were using. Suman worked on the videos while the rest 3 of us - Alima, Nicholas and me(Avani). The website came into existence smoothly after the wireframes was created.

<h2>Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.</h2>
